## Welcome!
I am a graduate student at the University of Washington working under Dr. Dale Durran on building machine learning for weather and climate prediction. My interests lie in training and evalutating deep learning methods for modeling the Earth system while taking advantage of the growing number of observational datasets in an effort to acheive more reliable means of simulating our environemnt.

## Research Interests
- Precipitation modeling
- Machine learning for weather and climate
- Extreme weather forecasting
- Hybrid AI–physics models
