# Hello!
My Name is Raul Moreno and I am a PhD student in the Atmospheric and Climate Sciences department at the University of Washington. I work with Dr. Dale Durran developing and evaluating DLESyM and other artificial intelligence Earth system modeling tools.

## About me
I graduated from Indiana University Bloomington with a bachelor of science in Atmospheric Sciences, a bachelor of arts in International Law and Institutions, and minors in Chinese and mathematics. At IU, I worked under Dr. Ben Kravitz evaluating radiative transfer model simulations of marine cloud brightening scenarios, as well as in the U.S. State Department Diplomacy Lab, researching volcanic hazards in Mexico. I was also part of the Chinese Flagship Program, funded by the U.S. Department of Defense to help students achieve professional-level proficiency in critical languages.

I am now a NASA FINESST fellow and a graduate student at the University of Washington working on building machine learning for weather and climate prediction. My interests lie in training and evaluating deep learning methods for modeling the Earth system while taking advantage of the growing number of observational datasets in an effort to achieve more reliable means of simulating our environment. I have also focused on precipitation modeling, using machine learning trained on satellite datasets to improve our estimates of surface precipitation.

## Research Interests
- Precipitation modeling
- Machine learning for weather and climate
- Extreme weather forecasting
- Hybrid AI–physics models
